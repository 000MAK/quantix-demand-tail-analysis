## Why this project

This repository is part of Mehmet Ali Kaya's applied statistics, actuarial-risk research and machine-learning portfolio. It emphasizes explicit assumptions, repeatable scripts, deterministic seeds, data provenance and honest evaluation rather than inflated performance claims.

**Focus:** Actuarial analytics · EVT / POT-GPD.

## Data and provenance

Hourly counts from the online UCI Bike Sharing dataset. Raw data is downloaded at runtime and is not committed.

- Source: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset)
- Attribution / terms: Fanaee-T, H. (2013), Bike Sharing, UCI Machine Learning Repository, DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5W894. This project is an educational EVT exercise, not a validated actuarial model.
- Data are not mirrored in this repository. Running the example requires network access and may download data or model artifacts into ignored local directories.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.11+ and an internet connection for the first full run. CPU-only execution is supported, though neural-network experiments may take a while.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python main.py
```

## Outputs

The script writes metrics and reports under `outputs/`; model projects also save the learned state or estimator there. Local data, outputs and model artifacts are ignored by Git by default. Most arguments can be inspected with:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

## Quality and scope

The CI workflow runs Python compilation and offline unit tests. Unit tests deliberately do not download datasets or train models. Full end-to-end runs should be performed separately in an internet-enabled environment. Performance results are not included as fixed claims because they depend on the data snapshot, dependencies, hardware and run settings.
